If you want to modify  tree materials we recomand to modify MountainTreeSpruce object. We reconnect other tree materials into 01 material to avoid new texture generation. 
Tree creater generates textures per tree but with our setup when we use put optimised materials from a tree into rest trees new textures are uneccesary. 
This mean each whole tree type use only 1 texture set.
If you want to change leaves color go to leaves for example Leaves_9 change its color and recompile tree_a which use that leaves.
