Thank you for Purchasing the First person hands asset.

This has recently been updated with generic animations that you can animate independently for unique motions. 
It is reccommended that you also animate things in a secondary sense by attaching the arms to an game object that will have its own animation, this will help for fine tuning positioning. You can make a copy of specific animation clips and edit them to your taste by removing or adjusting keys, see video on this items store page.

Many animation speeds will also need tweaking for better visual performance in your game.

This pack is an update and includes new animations and textures and also a new mixer shader for blending between the non-blood and blood versions of the texture.
