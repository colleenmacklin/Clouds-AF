#Poodle
Hey, do you see that one that looks like a poodle?
You don't know anything about poodles.
Do you?
#Frog
I see a Frog. Do you?
There is evidence that frogs have roamed the Earth for more than 200 million years. 
At least as long as the dinosaurs.
How did they survive the meteor impact?

Abe Lincoln once saw his son in the clouds.

Yep. It's a horse alrighty.
