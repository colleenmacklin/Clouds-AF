# Lux LWRP Lit Particles

Included in the package you downloaded you will find another package called "Lux LWRP Lit Particles".
This package includes all files needed for the LWRP (so you can remove all the other folders).

Lux LWRP Lit Particles need Unity 2019.1 or 2019.2. 2019.3 and the URP currently are not supported.
The included shaders and files are taken from the "Lux LWRP Essentials" package - so they will expand to a folder with this name.
As the LWRP shaders are derived from the LWRP particle shaders they offer slightly different inputs and functionality.
